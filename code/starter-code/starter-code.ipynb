    "While Hadoop streaming is a simple way to do simple map-reduce tasks, it's complicated to use and not really friendly when things fail and we have to debug our code. Also, if we wanted to do a join from two different sets of data, it would be complicate to handle both with a single mapper, while it'd be much easier to have two separate mappers and one reducer.\n",
